    <p>
        Healthcare today stands at the intersection of technology and innovation, driven by diverse data sourcesâ€”from clinical reports and electronic health records to medical imaging, vital signs, and numerous forms of unstructured data. While deep learning has significantly advanced medical imaging, the vast potential of integrating these abundant, multi-modal data streams remains largely untapped. This integration promises revolutionary improvements in patient outcomes, yet navigating this landscape poses unique and complex challenges due to the fragmented and isolated nature of healthcare data.
        
        This workshop addresses the critical questions facing researchers and practitioners: How can we effectively align and integrate multi-modal medical data? How do we tackle safety, privacy, interpretability, and the scarcity of clinically driven benchmarks? 
        </p>
        <p>
        Join us to explore cutting-edge research, engage with leading experts in the field, and discover exciting opportunities to leverage multi-modal models to drive the next generation of healthcare innovations. Be part of the conversation shaping the future of medicine.
    </p>
        <!-- Medicine is inherently multi-modal with data ranging from reports, electronic health records, imaging, vital
        signals, and various forms of unstructured data. Despite the significant attention given to deep learning
        applications in medical imaging, there's a notable scarcity of efforts to leverage the abundant multi-modal data
        available in the healthcare sector. Leveraging heterogeneous medical data presents unique challenges, as
        healthcare data sources are notably fragmented compared to other fields. The fragmented and isolated data
        sources present complex challenges that need to be navigated specifically when multi-modal requires the
        integration of many data sources to provide an improved patient improvement outcome. Additionally, there are
        other factors to consider such as best practices to align multi-modal data, addressing safety and privacy
        concerns, the absence of public benchmarks, issues with interpretability, and overcoming challenges related to
        publicly available data availability.

        The proposed workshop aims to enlighten the community about the latest research, the challenges faced while
        developing multi-modal models today and the opportunities for the future to improve healthcare globally. -->
